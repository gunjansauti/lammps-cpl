fix bfield command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID bfield bx by bz :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
bfield = style name of this fix command :l
bx,by,bz = B-field component values (magnetic field units) :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended to args :l
keyword = {region} :l
  {region} value = region-ID
    region-ID = ID of region atoms must be in to have added force
:ule

[Examples:]

fix all external-field bfield 1.0 0.0 0.0 :pre
fix all external-field bfield 0.0 v_b 0.0 region sub :pre

[Description:]

Add the effect of an external magnetic field to each charged atom. If the system
contains magnetic point-dipoles, also add a torque on the dipoles due to the
external magnetic field.

force F = q*(B x v) 

For charges, any of the 3 quantities defining the B-field components
can be specified as an equal-style "variable"_variable.html, namely {bx}, {by}, {bz}.  If the value is a
variable, it should be specified as v_name, where name is the variable
name.  In this case, the variable will be evaluated each timestep, and
its value used to determine the B-field component.

:line 

Adding a force or torque to atoms implies a change in their potential
energy as they move or rotate due to the applied B-field.

For dynamics via the "run" command, this energy can be optionally
added to the system's potential energy for thermodynamic output (see
below). For energy minimization via the "minimize" command, this
energy must be added to the system's potential energy to formulate a
self-consistent minimization problem (see below).

NOTE: the minimizer in LAMMPS does not rotate dipoles, so you should not expect to be able to
minimize the orientation of dipoles in an applied magnetic field.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  

This fix computes a global scalar which can be accessed by various "output
commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_15. The scalar is the potential
energy discussed above. The scalar calculated by this fix
is "extensive".

No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.
