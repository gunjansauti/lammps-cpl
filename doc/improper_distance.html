<P>where d is the distance between the central atom and the plane formed
by the other three atoms.  If the 4 atoms in an improper quadruplet
(listed in the data file read by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A>
command) are ordered I,J,K,L then the I-atom is assumed to be the
central atom.

</CENTER>
<P>Note that defining 4 atoms to interact in this way, does not mean that
bonds necessarily exist between I-J, J-K, or K-L, as they would in a
linear dihedral. Normally, the bonds I-J, I-K, I-L would exist for an
improper to be defined between the 4 atoms.
</P>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each improper type via
the improper_coeff command as in the example above, or in the data
file or restart files read by the read_data or read_restart commands:
</P>
<UL><LI>K_2 (energy/distance^2)
<LI>K_4 (energy/distance^4) 
</UL>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This improper style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-MISC package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A>
section for more info on packages.
