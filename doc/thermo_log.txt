thermo_log command :h3

[Syntax:]

thermo_log file keyword :pre

file = name of new thermofile
keyword = {append} if output should be appended to thermofile (optional) :ul

[Examples:]

thermo_log thermo.dat
thermo_log thermo.dat append :pre

[Description:]

This command closes the current LAMMPS thermo log file, opens a new
file with the specified name, and begins logging information to it.
If the specified file name is {none}, then no new log file is opened.
If the optional keyword {append} is specified, then output will be
appended to an existing log file, instead of overwriting it.

If multiple processor partitions are being used, the file name should
be a variable, so that different processors do not attempt to write to
the same thermo log file.

By default no thermo log file is created during a LAMMPS run.  The
name of the initial thermo log file can also be set by the command-line
switch -thermo.  See "Section_start 6"_Section_start.html#start_7 for
details.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

No thermo log file is created.
