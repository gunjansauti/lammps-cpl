compute cross command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID crosslink active reactive_type max_num_bonds crosslink reactive_type2 max_num_bonds :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
temp = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute myDCL all crosslink active 1 2 crosslink 3 3 :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the degree of cross-linking of a group of
atoms.  A compute of this style can be used in simulation of curing of polymers.

The degree of cross-linking is calculated by dividing the number of created bonds by 
maximum number of bonds that can be created in the system. :pre

See the "thermo_style" command for more details.

See "this howto section"_Section_howto.html#howto_16 of the manual for
a discussion of different ways to compute temperature and perform
thermostatting. 

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global scalar (the degree of cross-linkiong).
This value can be used by any command that uses global scalar from a compute as input.  
See "this section"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The scalar value calculated by this compute is "intensive".

[Restrictions:] none
