Build LAMMPS :h3

LAMMPS can be built from source code with either CMake or traditional
make.  As an alternative you can download a pre-built executable file
as described on "this page"_Install.html.

When building LAMMPS there are many options for what to
include/exclude.  If you have problems building, it is often due to
software issues on your local machine.  If you can, find a local
expert to help.  If you are still stuck, send an email to the LAMMPS
mail list.
