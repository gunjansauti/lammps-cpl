Running LAMMPS on Windows :h3

For running the non-MPI executable, follow these steps:

Get a command prompt by going to Start->Run... ,
then typing "cmd". :ulb,l

Move to the directory where you have your input, e.g. a copy of
the [in.lj] input from the bench folder. (e.g. by typing: cd "Documents"). :l

At the command prompt, type "lmp_serial -in in.lj", replacing [in.lj]
with the name of your LAMMPS input script. :l

The serial executable includes support for multi-threading
parallelization from the styles in the USER-OMP packages.

To run with, e.g. 4 threads, type "lmp_serial -in in.lj -pk omp 4 -sf omp"
:ule

For the MPI version, which allows you to run LAMMPS under Windows with
the more general message passing parallel library (LAMMPS has been
designed from ground up to use MPI efficiently), follow these steps:

Download and install a compatible MPI library binary package:
for 32-bit Windows
"mpich2-1.4.1p1-win-ia32.msi"_download.lammps.org/thirdparty/mpich2-1.4.1p1-win-ia32.msi
and for 64-bit Windows
"mpich2-1.4.1p1-win-x86-64.msi"_download.lammps.org/thirdparty/mpich2-1.4.1p1-win-x86-64.msi
:ulb,l

The LAMMPS Windows installer packages will automatically adjust your
path for the default location of this MPI package. After the installation
of the MPICH2 software, it needs to be integrated into the system.
For this you need to start a Command Prompt in {Administrator Mode}
(right click on the icon and select it). Change into the MPICH2
installation directory, then into the subdirectory [bin] and execute
[smpd.exe -install]. Exit the command window.

Get a new, regular command prompt by going to Start->Run... ,
then typing "cmd". :l

Move to the directory where you have your input file
(e.g. by typing: cd "Documents"). :l

Then type something like this:

mpiexec -localonly 4 lmp_mpi -in in.lj :pre
or

mpiexec -np 4 lmp_mpi -in in.lj :pre

replacing [in.lj] with the name of your LAMMPS input script. For the latter
case, you may be prompted to enter your password. :l

In this mode, output may not immediately show up on the screen, so if
your input script takes a long time to execute, you may need to be
patient before the output shows up. :l

The parallel executable can also run on a single processor by typing
something like:

lmp_mpi -in in.lj :pre

And the parallel executable also includes OpenMP multi-threading, which
can be combined with MPI using something like:

mpiexec -localonly 2 lmp_mpi -in in.lj -pk omp 2 -sf omp :pre
