Build LAMMPS with CMake :h3

quick try:
mkdir foo; cd foo
cmake ~/lammps/cmake .
make

how to run:
  to do a new build, run cmake in a new directory
  does not have to be in lammps dir
  use an arg that points to lammps/cmake
  will create an exe (after make) in this dir
  also creates many auxiliary files, including all Obj file
  must have no packages installed in src dir (use make no-all if
  necessary)
   this is different than traditional make
how to rerun:
  if edit any source files, can rerun just make, will work in incremental fashion
  if want to change settings for build itself, then rerun CMake
  when should you start fresh (just delete everything in dir)
  do not try to use env varaibles again, will conflict with Cache
two step build:
  cmake ...  # creates a Makefile
  make       # creates the executable
3 ways to run cmake: command-line, text menu, GUI
need version 3
when cmake runs:
  prints info to screen on what it found, what it will use (see section at end)
  puts command line in file for future reference
special env variables for package management
