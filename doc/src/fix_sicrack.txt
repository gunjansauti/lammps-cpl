[Description:]

This fix introduces and propagates a semi-infinite crack of desired 
tip intensity, position, and mode in a simulation block.  This is 
done by applying the equations of linear elastic fracture mechanics 
for displacement to all atoms in the block. A “skin” of atoms 
around the border parallel to the crack front should be kept f
ixed whereas the atoms around the crack tip are free to deform 
according to the formalism of molecular dynamics and the specified 
potential.  The package requires no external libraries, and multiple 
fracture modes and intensities can be combined based on the needs 
of the user.

Multiple fixes for multiple modes can be included in the same script 
and can be run simultaneously. The crack front will always be along 
the Z axis. The package is designed to run using units “metal”. 
The shear modulus should be entered in GPa, and the stress intensity 
in MPa√m.

To introduce and expand the crack with desired tip intensity, the 
displacement equations of linear elastic fracture mechanics are 
applied to all atoms in the defined sample, given below [1]:

ux = (KI/μ)*sqrt(rdist/(2*PI))*(cos(t/2)*(1.0 - 2.0*υ + sin^2(t/2)) 
+ (KII/μ)*sqrt(rdist/(2*PI))*(sin(t/2)*(2.0 - 2.0*υ + cos^2(t/2))
ux = (KI/μ)*sqrt(rdist/(2*PI))*(sin(t/2)*(1.0 - 2.0*υ - cos^2(t/2)) 
+ (KII/μ)*sqrt(rdist/(2*PI))*(cos(t/2)*(-1.0 + 2.0*υ + sin^2(t/2))
uz = KIII/μ*sqrt(rdist/&2*PI))*sin(t/2)

Wherein   KI, II, III  are all tip stress intensity values, with 
units MPa√m, μ is the shear modulus, and υ is the Poisson ratio 
of your material and r and t are the angle and distance to the 
crack tip in the x-y plane, respectively.  The program introduces 
a crack in the sample with a user-specified crack tip intensity 
value (K), with the mode specified.  Multiple different fixes 
can be defined in the same script if a user wants to propagate 
a crack with more than just one mode.  Once introduced, the 
crack can be expanded at a user-defined rate, with the 
K_increase parameter, per MD step.

This fix can be used for different crack modes (I, II, and III) 
such that behavior at and around the crack tip is governed by 
the molecular dynamics formalism, while the sample border is 
governed by the continuum fracture mechanics equations given 
above. In order to do this, the best practice is to first define 
a “border” or skin of atoms around the sample. To do this, 
utilize the “region” and “group” commands in tandem with the 
samples’ dimensions (see example scripts). This border needs 
to be somewhat larger than the range of the interatomic 
potential used and the atomic positions are kept fixed.  As 
an example, if you have a 40 nm by 40 nm by 40 nm cuboid 
structure filled with a single crystal of gold (lattice parameter 
0.408 nm) with origin in a corner and all initial atom 
coordinates positive, the crack front (as specified by the fix) 
will be parallel to the z axis, and the crack itself will 
oriented in the x direction.  The skin should be around 2.0 
nm thick, parallel to the crack front.  So, this is all 
atoms where x > 38, x < 2, and y > 38, y < 2.  All atoms 
in this region will be defined as group “border.”  Everything 
outside of it will be defined as group “mobile.” An example 
of this is documented in either of the input scripts.

It is important to note that if modes II or III are used without 
an additional fix to include a mode I contribution, any displaced 
atoms on the crack front that are close enough to the other side 
will re-bond, eliminating the defined front.  This is specifically 
different from the method of introducing a crack defined on the 
LAMMPS website because for this method, no atoms are deleted – 
only moved according to the equations given above.  So, in order 
to properly study mode II or III fracture behavior, a small mode 
I contribution must be added, to allow some separation between 
atoms on the crack front to deter bond formation.  Otherwise, 
the user must eliminate atoms along the crack front using the 
centrosymmetry or common neighbor analysis algorithms.

Figure 1 illustrates this for a mode 1 crack.

Similar setups can be used for modesII and III.

After a border has been defined, the user needs to open the crack 
to a specified intensity, through the fix, which is applied to all 
atoms (fixed and free, from the figure above).  Ideally, this 
initial opening should be at a value for critical stress intensity 
so that the crack will not close immediately after taking the 
formalism away.  Determining this optimum value for K usually 
takes a little trial and error.  For typical metals, a stress 
intensity of around K = 1.2 MPaÖm is a good place to start.  
In order to study crack propagation, this first fix command can 
be unfixed and a second fix can be applied with K_initial as 
zero, but K_increase is used to introduce additional crack opening.  
This value is the rate of increase of K per step.  The motion 
of the interior free atoms is governed by the molecular dynamics, 
while atom motion in the border, far from the crack tip is 
given by linear elastic fracture mechanics.

This formalism has been used for to simulate fracture behavior 
in zirconium, [2] tantalum [3] and nickel [4] . It has also 
been used to model microstructural evolution in the crack tip 
region in single and polycrystalline systems. [5, 6]

[Restrictions:]

The use of this fix is limited to the nvt and nve ensembles.  
Furthermore, due to the fact that the samples sides perpendicular 
to the Z direction are being continuously deformed, we cannot 
have periodic boundary conditions in either the x or y directions.  
Both periodic or free surface boundary conditions along the Z axis 
are possible.   Finally, if simulating a brittle material, where 
the crack tip is expected to propagate into the sample with 
increasing applied stress tip intensity, the user will need to 
manually move the crack tip forward by altering the input 
script and keeping up with the tip by checking the dump files, 
or sample snapshots as the deformation proceeds.
