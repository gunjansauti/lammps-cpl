bond_style oxdna_fene command :h3

[Syntax:]

bond_style oxdna_fene :pre

[Examples:]

bond_style oxdna_fene
bond_coeff * 2.0 0.25 0.7525 :pre

[Description:]

The {oxdna_fene} bond style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/bond_oxdna_fene.jpg)

to define a modified finite extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) potential
"(Ouldridge)"_#oxdna_fene to model the connectivity of the phosphate backbone
in the oxDNA force field for coarse-grained modelling of DNA. 

The following coefficients must be defined for the bond type via the
"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html command exactly as given in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

epsilon (energy)
Delta (distance)
r0 (distance) :ul

An example input file and data files can be found in /examples/USER/cgdna/input/.
A simple python setup tool which creates single straight or helical DNA strands as well as 
DNA duplexes and arrays of duplexes can be found in /examples/USER/cgdna/util/.
A technical report with details on the structure of the input file 
can be found in /examples/USER/cgdna/doc/.

NOTE: This bond style should always be used together with the related oxDNA pair styles
for excluded volume, hydrogen-bonding, stacking, cross-stacking
and coaxial stacking interactions (see also documentation of 
"pair_style oxdna_excv"_pair_oxdna_excv.html). The coefficients
in the example above cannot be changed without 
reparametrizing the entire model.

[Restrictions:]

This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULE and ASPHERE package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info on packages.
