Install LAMMPS :h3

You can download LAMMPS as an executable or as source code.

If you go with source code (either as a tarball or via Git/SVN), you
also have to "build LAMMPS"_Build.html.  You then have more
flexibility as to what features to include or exclude in the build.
If you plan to "modify or extend LAMMPS"_Modify.html, then you need
the source code.
