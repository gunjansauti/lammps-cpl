Build LAMMPS with JPG, PNG, FFMPEG support :h3

The 3 JPG variables allow you to specify a JPEG and/or PNG library
which LAMMPS uses when writing out JPEG or PNG files via the "dump
image"_dump_image.html command.  These can be left blank if you do not
use the -DLAMMPS_JPEG or -DLAMMPS_PNG switches discussed above in Step
4, since in that case JPEG/PNG output will be disabled.

A standard JPEG library usually goes by the name libjpeg.a or
libjpeg.so and has an associated header file jpeglib.h.  Whichever
JPEG library you have on your platform, you'll need to set the
appropriate JPG_INC, JPG_PATH, and JPG_LIB variables, so that the
compiler and linker can find it.

A standard PNG library usually goes by the name libpng.a or libpng.so
and has an associated header file png.h.  Whichever PNG library you
have on your platform, you'll need to set the appropriate JPG_INC,
JPG_PATH, and JPG_LIB variables, so that the compiler and linker can
find it.

As before, if these header and library files are in the usual place on
your machine, you may not need to set these variables.
