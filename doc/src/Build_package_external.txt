Package that require external libraries :h3

Packages in the tables "Section 4"_Section_packages.html with an "ext"
in the last column link to external libraries whose source code is not
included with LAMMPS.  You must first download and install the library
before building LAMMPS with that package installed.  E.g. the voronoi
package links to the freely available "Voro++ library"_voro_home2.  You
can often do the download/build in one step by typing "make lib-name
args=..." from the src dir, with appropriate arguments.  You can leave
off the args to see a help message.  See "Section
4"_Section_packages.html for details for each package.
