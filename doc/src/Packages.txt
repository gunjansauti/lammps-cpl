Optional packages :h3

This section gives an overview of the optional packages that extend
LAMMPS functionality with instructions on how to build LAMMPS with
each of them.  Packages are groups of files that enable a specific set
of features.  For example, force fields for molecular systems or
granular systems are in packages.  You can see the list of all
packages and "make" commands to manage them by typing "make package"
from within the src directory of the LAMMPS distribution.  "Section
2.3"_Section_start.html#start_3 gives general info on how to install
and un-install packages as part of the LAMMPS build process.

Either of these kinds of packages may work as is, may require some
additional code compiled located in the lib folder, or may require
an external library to be downloaded, compiled, installed, and LAMMPS
configured to know about its location and additional compiler flags.
You can often do the build of the internal or external libraries
in one step by typing "make lib-name args='...'" from the src dir,
with appropriate arguments included in args='...'. If you just type
"make lib-name" you should see a help message about supported flags
and some examples. For more details about this, please study the
tables below and the sections about the individual packages.

Standard packages are supported by the LAMMPS developers and are
written in a syntax and style consistent with the rest of LAMMPS.
This means the developers will answer questions about them, debug and
fix them if necessary, and keep them compatible with future changes to
LAMMPS.

User packages have been contributed by users, and begin with the
"user" prefix.  If they are a single command (single file), they are
typically in the user-misc package.  User packages don't necessarily
meet the requirements of the standard packages. This means the
developers will try to keep things working and usually can answer
technical questions about compiling the package. If you have problems
using a feature provided in a user package, you may need to contact
the contributor directly to get help.  Information on how to submit
additions you make to LAMMPS as single files or as a standard or user
package are given in "this section"_Section_modify.html#mod_15 of the
manual.

Following the next two tables is a sub-section for each package.  It
lists authors (if applicable) and summarizes the package contents.  It
has specific instructions on how to install the package, including (if
necessary) downloading or building any extra library it requires. It
also gives links to documentation, example scripts, and
pictures/movies (if available) that illustrate use of the package.

NOTE: To see the complete list of commands a package adds to LAMMPS,
just look at the files in its src directory, e.g. "ls src/GRANULAR".
Files with names that start with fix, compute, atom, pair, bond,
angle, etc correspond to commands with the same style names.
