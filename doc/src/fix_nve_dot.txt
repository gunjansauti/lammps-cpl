fix nve/dot command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID nve/dot :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
nve/dot = style name of this fix command :l
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all   nve/dot :pre

[Description:]

Apply a rigid-body integrator as described in "(Davidchack)"_#Davidchack
to a group of atoms.  This command performs Molecular Dynamics (MD)
via a velocity-Verlet algorithm and a rotation of the quaternion degrees
of freedom. 
This command is equivalent to the  
"fix langevin"_fix_langevin.html and its {angmom} option, but combines 
the "fix nve"_fix_nve.html and the "fix langevin"_fix_langevin.html in 
one single command. It features improved stability permitting larger 
timestep sizes.

The total force on each atom will have the form:

F = Fc + Ff + Fr
Ff = - (m / damp) v
Fr is proportional to sqrt(Kb T m / (dt damp)) :pre

Fc is the conservative force computed via the usual inter-particle
interactions ("pair_style"_pair_style.html,
"bond_style"_bond_style.html, etc).

The Ff and Fr terms are implicitely added by this fix on a per-particle basis.

Ff is a frictional drag or viscous damping term proportional to the
particle's velocity.  The proportionality constant for each atom is
computed as m/damp, where m is the mass of the particle and damp is
the damping factor specified by the user.

Fr is a force due to solvent atoms at a temperature T randomly bumping
into the particle.  As derived from the fluctuation/dissipation
theorem, its magnitude as shown above is proportional to sqrt(Kb T m /
dt damp), where Kb is the Boltzmann constant, T is the desired
temperature, m is the mass of the particle, dt is the timestep size,
and damp is the damping factor.  Random numbers are used to randomize
the direction and magnitude of this force as described in
"(Dunweg)"_#Dunweg, where a uniform random number is used (instead of
a Gaussian random number) for speed.

This fix has to be used together with the {angmom} keyword. The 
particles are always considered to have a finite size, hence
the rotational degrees of freedom are also being thermostatted.

NOTE: Unlike the "fix langevin"_fix_langevin.html this command performs
also time integration of the translational and quaternion degrees of freedom.

The desired temperature at each timestep has to be a constant value during the
run, therefore {Tstart} has to be equal to {Tstop}.

The {damp} parameter is specified in time units and determines how
rapidly the temperature is relaxed.  For example, a value of 0.03
means to relax the temperature in a timespan of (roughly) 0.03 time
units (tau - see the "units"_units.html command).
The damp factor can be thought of as inversely related to the
viscosity of the solvent. I.e. a small relaxation time implies a
hi-viscosity solvent and vice versa.  See the discussion about gamma
and viscosity in the documentation for the "fix
viscous"_fix_viscous.html command for more details.

The random # {seed} must be a positive integer. A Marsaglia random
number generator is used.  Each processor uses the input seed to
generate its own unique seed and its own stream of random numbers.
Thus the dynamics of the system will not be identical on two runs on
different numbers of processors.

The keyword/value option has to be used in the following way:

The keyword {angmom} enables thermostatting of the rotational degrees of 
freedom in addition to the usual translational degrees of freedom. 
Hence, this fix can only be used for finite-size particles.

The scale factor With the {angmom} keyword gives the ratio of the rotational to 
translational friction coefficient.
