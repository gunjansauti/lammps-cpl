This package implements the PINN potential as a LAMMPS pair style.

The description of the PINN model can be found in G. P. Purja Pun et al.,
"Development of a general-purpose machine-learning interatomic potential
for aluminum by the physically informed neural network method",
PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS 4, 113807 (2020).

The package requires no external libraries and can be built with the current
stable version of LAMMPS with no modification to any makefile using the following commands.

make clean-all
make yes-USER-PINN
make mpi

In your LAMMPS input script, specifiy
	pair_style      pinn
	pair_coeff      * * Al_2020.pinn Al

to enable the use of this implementation.
