This package contains a LAMMPS implementation of coarse-grained
models of DNA, which can be used to model sequence-specific
DNA strands.

See the doc pages and [1,2] for the individual bond and pair styles. 
The packages contains also a new Langevin-type rigid-body integrator,
which has also its own doc page and is explained in [2].

Example input and data files can be found in 
/examples/USER/cgdna/examples/duplex1/ and /duplex2/.
A simple python setup tool which creates single straight or helical DNA 
strands as well as DNA duplexes and arrays of duplexes can be found in 
/examples/USER/cgdna/util/.
A technical report with details on the structure of the input file can be found in 
/examples/USER/cgdna/doc/.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This package can only be used if LAMMPS is compiled
with the MOLECULE and ASPHERE packages.  These should be included 
in the LAMMPS build by typing "make yes-asphere yes-molecule" prior 
to the usual compilation (see the "Including/excluding packages" 
section of the LAMMPS manual).
