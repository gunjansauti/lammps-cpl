Mango-Selm Package: Fluctuating Hydrodynamics for LAMMPS

http://mango-selm.org/

----------------------------------------------------------------
Make files for building the SELM package as part of LAMMPS.

Copy these Makefiles to your LAMMPS source sub-directory 
MAKE or MAKE/MINE 

Depending on the version of LAMMPS you may need to change
the name of MPI link library in the Makefile or in the 
/STUBS/ directory (use symbolic link).   

Some integrators in the SELM package may require the 
Fast Fourier Transform and package FFTW3.

The Makefiles may need edits to adjust for the location 
of this and other libraries.
