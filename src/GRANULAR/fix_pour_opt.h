/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Cannot yet use fix pour with the KOKKOS package

This feature is not yet supported.

E: Fix pour requires atom attributes radius, rmass

The atom style defined does not have these attributes.

E: Invalid atom type in fix pour command

Self-explanatory.

E: Must specify a region in fix pour

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix pour region does not support a bounding box

Not all regions represent bounded volumes.  You cannot use
such a region with the fix pour command.

E: Fix pour region cannot be dynamic

Only static regions can be used with fix pour.

E: Insertion region extends outside simulation box

Self-explanatory.

E: Must use a z-axis cylinder region with fix pour

Self-explanatory.

E: Must use a block or cylinder region with fix pour

Self-explanatory.

E: Must use a block region with fix pour for 2d simulations

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot use fix_pour unless atoms have IDs

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix pour molecule must have coordinates

The defined molecule does not specify coordinates.

E: Fix pour molecule must have atom types

The defined molecule does not specify atom types.

E: Invalid atom type in fix pour mol command

The atom types in the defined molecule are added to the value
specified in the create_atoms command, as an offset.  The final value
for each atom must be between 1 to N, where N is the number of atom
types.

E: Fix pour molecule template ID must be same as atom style template ID

When using atom_style template, you cannot pour molecules that are
not in that template.

E: Cannot use fix pour rigid and not molecule

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot use fix pour shake and not molecule

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot use fix pour rigid and shake

These two attributes are conflicting.

E: No fix gravity defined for fix pour

Gravity is required to use fix pour.

E: Fix pour insertion count per timestep is 0

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot use fix pour with triclinic box

This option is not yet supported.

E: Gravity must point in -z to use with fix pour in 3d

Self-explanatory.

E: Gravity must point in -y to use with fix pour in 2d

Self-explanatory.

E: Gravity changed since fix pour was created

The gravity vector defined by fix gravity must be static.

E: Fix pour rigid fix does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix pour and fix rigid/small not using same molecule template ID

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix pour shake fix does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix pour and fix shake not using same molecule template ID

Self-explanatory.

W: Less insertions than requested

The fix pour command was unsuccessful at finding open space
for as many particles as it tried to insert.

E: Too many total atoms

See the setting for bigint in the src/lmptype.h file.

E: New atom IDs exceed maximum allowed ID

See the setting for tagint in the src/lmptype.h file.

E: Fix pour region ID does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Molecule template ID for fix pour does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix pour polydisperse fractions do not sum to 1.0

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot change timestep with fix pour

This is because fix pour pre-computes the time delay for particles to
fall out of the insertion volume due to gravity.
