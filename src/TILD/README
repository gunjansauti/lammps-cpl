This package provides a kspace style (TILD) to calculate 
non-bonded pairwise forces indirectly via a particle-mesh scheme 
through a gridded density representation. This potential does NOT 
calculate any Coulombic interactions.

Include the TILD and KSPACE packages when building LAMMPS.
No additional libraries are required to use TILD.

For questions about TILD, please contact:
