This package provides a kspace style (TILD) to calculate 
non-bonded pairwise forces indirectly via a particle-mesh scheme 
through a gridded density representation. This potential does NOT 
calculate any Coulombic interactions.

Include the TILD and KSPACE packages when building LAMMPS.
The only library required to use TILD is FFT. 
By default, LAMMPS uses the KISS library with other options available.
More information can be found at https://docs.lammps.org/Build_settings.html#fft-library
