This package provides the h5md dump style.

See the doc page for dump_h5md. This dump style requires building the bundled
ch5md library and HDF5 (see lib/ch5md/README).

The person who created this package is Pierre de Buyl (KU Leuven), see
http://pdebuyl.be/ for contact information. Contact him directly if you have
questions.
