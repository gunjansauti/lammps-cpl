Description:
Style fene/nm is based on the standard fene which consists of two components: 1. an attractive logarithmic term and 2. a repulsive Lennard-Joines (12-6) term. 

Unlike the standard fene style, fene/nm substitutes the standard (12-6) LJ term with a modified generalized (n-m) LJ potential (style nm/split).

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the bond_coeff command as in the example above, or in the data file or restart files read by the read_data or read_restart commands:
-Spring Constant K
-Maximum bond extension R_0
-Energy
-Monomer Diameter Ïƒ
