mof5:
    NPT simulation of MOF5 using a QuickFF force field

mil53al:
    NPT simulation of MIL-53(Al) using a QuickFF force field.
    If the pressure is high enough (for instance 2000 atm),
    a phase transition from large pore to narrow pore is observed

mil53al_pressure_profile:
    Construct the pressure profile as a function of the volume,
    by performing fixed-volume simulations. Starting configurations
    are extracted from an NPT simulation (see mil53al directory)
    Theoretical background is provided in
    https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00748
