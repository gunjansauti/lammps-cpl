This example shows how to construct the pressure profile as a function of the
volume. Theoretical background is provided in

It is advised to use significantly longer simulation times for serious
production runs.

Step 1:
    Run one or more NPT simulations. For this example the necessary files are
    in ../mil53al Make sure that all volumes you are interested in, are
    sampled during these simulations.

Step 2:
    Use the prepare.py script to generate the input files for the fixed-volume
    simulations. The script will extract initial configurations from the NPT
    simulations in step 1 that are close to the volumes for which you want to
    compute the pressure.

Step 3:
    Run all fixed-volume simulations using the run_fixed_volume.sh script

Step 4:
    Use the postprocess.py script to read the average pressure from each
    fixed-volume simulation. Using thermodynamic integration, also the free
    energy profile can be obtained.
