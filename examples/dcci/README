Nonequilibrium Free-energy calculation of Phase-Boundaries using LAMMPS

The dcci command computes the phase-boundaries of classical systems using 
a dynamic Clausius-Clapeyron integration (dCCI) method. 
The advantage of the dCCI method gives coexistence curves spanning a wide 
range of thermodynamic states from relatively short single non-equilibrium simulations. 
As an illustrated example we determined the coexistence curve of the fcc-liquid phase 
of Lennard-Jones system, project available in the follow github project:

To perform the DCCI method, it is necessary to know one coexistence point between the phases.
In this case, the initial coexistence point corresponds to a temperature of T=0.77 and 
a pressure of P=1. The coexistence curveis calculated for the pressure range from 1 to 174.
